		p.standalone The examples below are a demonstration of how groups of farmers in agro geo-clusters (AGCs) can use our web-based tool to quickly, precisely and digitally divvy up their delineated, aggregate land among their members, according to the number of hectares each member elected to cultivate. 
		p.standalone The tool helped eliminate land boundary disputes, and sped up their access to funding since lenders were assured of the farmers field identity.

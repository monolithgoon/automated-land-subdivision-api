					p.standalone  Smallholder farmers in Nigeria typically work at near-subsistence levels on informal plots of land that are often just a fraction of an acre. This makes it near impossible to provide them funding or crop insurance. 

					p.standalone.bold However, they become much more attractive to lenders when they band together, pooling their effort to cultivate on a single land expanse, forming contiguous farmland aggregation structures ("agro geo-clusters" or AGCs). 

					p.standalone These clusters present a lower risk profile to a lender.

							h3 Auto-generated Farm Plots + Strong farmland identity
							div 

					p.standalone The examples below demonstrate how groups of farmers in agro geo-clusters use our web-based tool to quickly, affordably, precisely and digitally divvy-up their shared land, each plot sized according to the number of hectares each farmer has elected to cultivate. 

					p.standalone.bold Our farmland auto-parcelization tool helps eliminate land boundary disputes among farmers, reduces their land preparation costs per hectare, and speeds up their access to funding since lenders are assured of the farmers' field identity.

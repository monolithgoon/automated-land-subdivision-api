					p.standalone  Smallholder farmers in Nigeria typically work at near-subsistence levels on informal plots of land that are often just a fraction of an acre. This makes it near impossible to provide them funding or crop insurance. 

					p.standalone.bold However, they become much more attractive to lenders when they band together, pooling their effort to cultivate on a single land expanse, forming contiguous farmland aggregation structures ("agro geo-clusters" or AGCs). 

					p.standalone These clusters present a lower risk profile to a lender.

					p.standalone The examples below are a demonstration of how groups of farmers in AGCs use our web-based tool to quickly, precisely and digitally divvy up their delineated, aggregate land among their members, according to the number of hectares each member elected to cultivate. 

					p.standalone.bold The tool helps eliminate land boundary disputes among farmers, and speeds up their access to funding since lenders are assured of the farmers' field identity.
